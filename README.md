# Virtual-Try-On

In 21st century, fashion is not just something we wear; itâ€™s a way of life and hence it needs to be a wonderful experience while spending so much of time buying it. With the introduction of smart phones and tablets, we can enjoy shopping anytime and while sitting in any part of the world.

Online shopping has certainly replaced the traditional way of shopping for daily goods and clothing. Today, almost every online store offers cash on delivery, free shipping and discounted prices. These online shopping stores eliminate the hassles of parking, getting stuck in traffic jams and standing in long queues for billing. This is the reason that majority of the people have turned to online shopping. 

There is no doubt that these are some of the attractive features that catches the attention of the consumers. But there is one small issue that could make people lose interest in online shopping i.e. it does not guarantee the perfect size of the clothing. This results in a number of products being returned and the time taking to replace it with the correct sized one is long. 

So for this we have proposed a system which allows the user to see a virtual image of themselves in the desired cloth of their preference which increases the time efficiency and improve the accessibility of clothes try on by creating a virtual dressing room environment. Our proposed approach is mainly based on extraction of the user image from the video stream and alignment of models. Extraction of user allows us to create an augmented reality environment by isolating the user area from the video stream and superimposing it onto a virtual environment in the user interface. Finally, the user can see the image of the shirt on self and then choose to buy the product.
